# [WIP] Budgeting App

### This is a simple, CLI-based (as of now) app to plan - and hopefully stick to - a monthly budget.

As of now, the app only takes in a value from a user in the CLI, then performs a calculation to split the budget into 3 
groups: needs, savings, and wants.


### Needs - 50%

Needs consist of things you cannot live without, such as a mortgage payment, utilities bills, groceries, gas/other
transportation payments, and/or healthcare. 50% of the inputted budget is allocated to this category.

### Savings - 30%

Savings more or less speak for themselves - they consist of accounts such as a Registered Retirement Savings Plan 
(RRSP), debt or loan repayment, emergency funds, and, of course, the savings account. 30% of the inputted budget is
assigned here.

### Wants - 20%

The remaining value of the budget is allocated here, in the 'wants' category. Wants consist of everything not covered in
the above 2 groups - dining out, media subscriptions, strictly unnecessary products required to survive.

## Plans for the Future

### As stated in the opening header, this project is very much a work in progress. 

I have several ideas on how to expand this budgeting app, however as I am currently a student my time to work on it is
very limited. That being said, here are a few changes and features that can be expected over the next few updates:

- [ ] Users will be able to input custom bill payment values, which will increase accuracy of budgeting
- [ ] Different budget periods, instead of being limited to monthly
- [ ] Savings forecast across different time periods

As well as much more to come over the following months/years!
